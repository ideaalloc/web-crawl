I think smoothies would be a good bet for those that like smoothies, unfortunately, my kids don't care for them. I think a frosty would work too if you were willing to make that every time... in the end, they didn't work for us because they hated the taste.

I tried floss picks from other companies and found either they don't work in my mouth, and/or their floss breaks and/or gets stuck in my teeth, both things I dislike intensely.  I've tried the angle floss picks and they won't work in my mouth. I don't like flosses that are \"too thick\" and don't fit between my teeth or ones that are \"too thin\" and fray or split when moving them between my teeth. Suddenly while writing this review I'm starting to feel a bit like Golidlocks but the floss on these floss picks IS \"just right\". These picks are perfect for me. They're packaged well, the package opens easily and importantly ALSO closes back up easily and securely. For every 30 count, maybe for one or two, the floss will split and you'll abort the flossing process and reach for another, but in any given package, you can therefore expect that 28 or 29 picks will function perfectly. This is a much better performance than other floss picks from other companies whose products I've purchased, where I've discard 3 or 4 in a row looking for one that doesn't break.\n", "\n  Makes Flossing Easy!", "I love these floss picks; have used this style for 3-4 years.

They have the perfect grip to use to floss between tightly spaced and crowded teeth.

I was never great at keeping up with it until I found this style Glide Floss Picks. Now I floss just about every day and it isn't a chore at all. I can't use regular floss string because trying to get two hands in my mouth to reach my back teeth is just ridiculous. The straight across style floss picks don't make it any easier to get to your back teeth, which are really the most difficult to deal with, because your cheeks are still in the way.", "That is why these floss picks are great. The design of these Glide Floss Picks are perfect because it makes reaching your back teeth very easy going straight into your mouth, and not having to come in from the side where your cheeks are in the way.

When I found a six-pack I ordered them immediately.  I have some knock-offs and they are total crap so don't be fooled by imitators.  Let's face it: most people don't floss as much as we are supposed to.  Using traditional floss is difficult, awkward and sometimes painful.  The string cuts into your finger and it's hard to get to back teeth.  These flossers eliminate all of those concerns.  If you have these you WILL floss everyday because it is so flippin' simple you no longer have a good excuse not to.  Your dentist will praise you for having such lovely teeth and gums.\n", "\n  I love these floss picks. Some of my teeth are very close together and I find that with string floss I end up cutting circulation off to my fingertips trying to pull the floss between my teeth. These are so much more convenient, and I love the additional 'pick' portion of these, which allows me to get food bits out of larger spaces at the gum line. They have no taste/scent and are pretty strong (i.e. they rarely break/tear during use, unlike string floss).  I wish they weren't so pricey, but you get what you pay for.  I keep a bag in my desk drawer at the office and another bag of these in the living room so I can floss while watching TV in the evenings.\n", "\n  I actually like the mint flavored glide picks, but have purchased them at Costco and online with no luck on getting through a flossing without them breaking and using 2+ per floss.

No matter how hydrated I am, my lips are always dry.  I have over 50 lip balms trying to find something that will make my lips soft without applying lip balm every hour.  I tried the new neosporin lip balms and fell in love with them.  I can apply this at night and it is still on my lips in the morning.  Plus my lips are softer.  Yes it is $4, but if it works, it is worth it.  I was very sceptical, but after the first night I was surprised and happy. If you're like me who's spent a lot of money on different lip balms to find relief, this is the product for you.\n", "\n  My daughter has had a nasty \"lip licker's dermatitis\" all winter and it's been hard to find something she'll tolerate. Don't want candy flavors or she'll lick it, and she doesn't like the menthol tingle of Carmex. We tried straight petroleum jelly and straight lanolin but she fought us on those too - I think they were too sticky (and Vaseline does have an odor when it's right under your nose.) Anyway, this is the winner. Don't listen to people who say its just white petroleum jelly. That's the main ingredient, but it's followed by lanolin, paraffin, cocoa butter, mineral oil, and a bunch of stuff I don't recognize. It's not as greasy as petroleum jelly and it has a mild earthy scent, like aloe. We slather it on at night and again in the morning, and after four days the dermatitis is nearly gone. Pricey, but worth it.\n", "\n  I had extremely dry lips due to the very cold weather.  My lips were in very bad shape and desperately needed exfoliation.  I decided to try this product after a beauty editor recommended it as one of the best new products on the \"Today\" show.  After using this treatment one night my lips were softer and smoother the very next day. I plan to continue using this product nightly. This is a night treatment since there is a slight white pasty look to the cream.  I highly recommend this product.\n", "\n  My 6 year old daughter gets severe chapping in her lips as well as the skin above and below her lips. It gets red, dry and irritated (and of course she is 6 so she rubs them on her shirt and pretty much disregards it). She looked so miserable and unattractive with red rings around her lips I decided to look into something other than the waxy lip sticks that have done NOTHING to improve the condition of her mouth. After some quick research, this product was recommended and I am beyond pleased with the result. I applied a layer to her lips and skin before bed and then again before I went to bed when she was sleeping. When she woke up, the redness was nearly gone and her lips and skin were smoothed out and almost back to normal. I will continue to do this over the next few nights. I have a great feeling her lips will be back to normal very soon. Great product!\n", "\n  A little greasy but works great for extremely chapped lips. As a man I like that it comes in the non lipstick container. I use this at night before bed and the aquaphor during the day. I had a cracked lip that would not heal. No matter what I did nothing worked. It kept cracking over and over. I finally ordered this and it worked\n", "\n  I suffer from perpetually chapped lips even in the summer, and have tried dozens of drug store lip balms and ones I get from beauty boxes. I very rarely use the same product twice because there's so many new things to try, but this is a staple in my routine. This balm is medium consistency, white, and spreads easily. It wears off fairly easily since it is not at all waxy (huge plus), so I use it only at night when I'd get the most benefit out of it. I wake up with a thin layer of moisture still on my lips, and this is amazing for post-dentist days when the sides of my mouth are raw or cut. Cannot recommend this stuff enough.\n", "\n  A little pricey - but my lips are super smooth. The first day all the dead skin came off...then by the next day- forget about it, I could kiss myself!\n", "\n  I thought it would be clear with a petroleum-jelly texture like the ointment from the tube, but it was a very emollient, white cream that does NOT rub it and disappear.

I like the way it easily goes from cm to inches. The readings are accurate. Here why: When you take a measurement, the tape will stop and not let your skin go in like a measuring tape will do. Of course, you must measure in the same place each time you do a measurement or it will be inaccurate. That's not always easy to do. I often take two or three readings and accept the largest one (as much as I hate to.) At least I know that's the right one.", "I do wonder how long the tape itself will last. Only time will tell. But of all the measuring devices I have used, I like this one the best and highly recommend it.", "UPDATE: I've had two of these because this one broke. Actually, the tape end tore off, causing the entire tape to retract, making it useless. I bought another one and within two years it did the same thing. Now, two years is a reasonably long run I guess. But I want something that measures and that I use only weekly to last longer. So, I'm going back to my MyoTape. I also question the accuracy of this product. It some cases it runs about the same as a regular tape. But, in other cases, not so much.

It is the most comprehensive formula to nutritionally support healthy joint function. The entire formula is truly remarkable, and provides sound nutritional support for joint health. Before we are born, chondrocytes work rapidly to build protection into our developing skeletons. Then we are born, grow, and age. The older we become, the slower chondrocytes work. As chondrocyte activity flags over time, they eventually fail to adequately compensate for the daily wear and tear placed on joints by an active lifestyle. As a result, nearly everyone has some degree of cartilage breakdown by the age of 32 to 35. For centuries it was thought that the gradual deterioration made joint pain and loss of mobility an inevitable fact of aging. Today?s science has shown us that the function of cartilage-building cells (chondrocytes) can be sustained as long as their nutritional requirements are met. Cartilage can indeed be brought back to greater levels of health, strengthened and thickened if proper nutrients are supplied. There is one controlling principle in the effort to rebuild cartilage: There must be some cartilage with viable chondrocytes in the joint in order for repair to proceed. If prior joint surgeries have removed all cartilage, or if all cartilage in the joint has been worn completely away, then there would be no chondrocytes on site that could initiate the reconstruction process. But most damaged joints do retain a good measure of cartilage. They can benefit from Joint Vibrance.\n\t        \n        "]},

I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn't look so similar I wouldn't complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn't even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn't done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...

All the rubber tunes break off one by one and the rubber grip coating on the toothbrush end, peels off too.  I'm tired of this newly cheapened quality, choking hazard toothbrush.

I was going weeks without \"going\" and after that it was still with major intervention.  I also had a colonoscopy after Sitz Marker and it confirmed the inertia. The dr said to try the Linzess again (which didn't help in the first place).  And if it didn't help, to see a surgeon about having my colon removed.  No way did I want to have surgery, but I thought I had exhausted all other options.  I have tried nearly everything I could think of and then some. I still always felt that finding the right probiotic just had to be the key to helping to some degree, but I didn't have any idea which one that would be.  So I did some more research.  I'm really not sure where I came across my info after googling \"Best Probiotics for Constipation\", but it lead me to this product. So, after reading the great reviews, I bought it with not much hope but felt I had nothing to lose.  I read it could take up to three weeks to start seeing results so I settled it.

Luckily, at only 100 calories each, the small size was not a huge deal, I just found that I wasn't entirely satisfied after just eating 1.

I really didn't like those things very much, and it probably led to me not flossing quite as much (or as well) as I should have.  Once I got my braces off (at the ripe old age of 28!), the orthodontist glued a wire to the middle six teeth on the bottom.  So I did not escape the need to use some sort of device to floss between the teeth on the bottom.", "I found these at a drugstore one day and decided to try them.  The appealed to me because there was a stiff part on the end that eliminated the need for a threader.  Plus, they incorporated Glide floss, which I had found to be my favorite (and least likely to shred on dental work) when I had braces.  Finally, they were individually wrapped (especially great if you want to travel and only bring along 2 or 3).", "I'm very happy with these.  I find them much easier to use than the blue floss threaders, at least for my own personal situation.  (Sometimes I had trouble getting the blue things + floss through the places where they needed to go, but these are narrower at the stiff part so they'll fit more places.)  Definitely recommended if you have any sort of dental or orthodontic work/device that makes it difficult to use regular (non-threaded) floss.\n", "\n  Excellent product.  After my braces were removed and the wires attached behind my teeth to help keep them in place I was using Oral B SuperFloss.  Despite being very careful this floss is very rough (I'm not talking about the thick part, even the thin part was very rough).  In two months I had managed to detach both wires.  The dentist recommended I use glider floss which is much more gentle.  I couldn't find it in any stores so I bought it on Amazon.  It is like switching from canvas to satin bedsheets!!  And it is much easier to pull through so I don't fear that my wires will detach again.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the only minor draw back is that occasionally it does snag/shred a bit.  Not a big deal as the micro thin shredded bit pulls out easily.  But basically this product is very near perfect.\n", "\n  I have tried several brands of bridge floss. They were all difficult to use, often the stiffer part being too big for my teeth (as in a store brand I got) or did not slide smoothly between my teeth (as in Oral B). Glide is the best. It works well with a tight-fitting bridge and also works well with the rest of my mouth. I hope they keep making it for a long time.\n", "\n  I've been in my braces for just over six months, and am quite thankful for this floss. It's very smooth, and gets inbetween my teeth very throughly. It's easy to use, and doesn't take that much longer than using regular floss. It gets in between my teeth very easily, and is a very important step in my oral hygiene. My dentist and orthodontist both recommend this floss. There isn't much flavour to it, of which I am glad.", "I haven't had the same luck with cheaper threader floss, it just gets snagged and falls apart and ends up taking loads more time. However, I get this at the grocery store (usually Target) for about $2.50-$3. If I couldn't get this at the store though, I would still pay amazon's price for this floss (currently $5) over going with a cheaper threader floss.\n", "\n  I love the product.  I feel it's a little overpriced. Then with the shipping I felt it was a rediculous price to pay.  But I cannot find them in any of the stores so the shipping was necessary to get them.

But, by the time you add shipping costs, could have been purchased at a local store for cheaper.\n", "\n  I have braces and it takes longer for me to floss with this Glide Threader floss than a generic counterpart I've used previously.
